## Sample Data Structure

The system currently includes sample interview data for demonstration:

```javascript
{
  agent_id: 'agent_001',
  candidate_name: 'John Smith',
  role: 'Software Engineer',
  status: 'completed',
  created_at: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z',
  duration: '25 minutes',
  has_transcript: true
}
```

## Responsive Design

The interface is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop**: Grid layout with multiple columns
- **Tablet**: Adjusted grid with fewer columns
- **Mobile**: Single column layout with stacked controls

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Batch Transcript Analysis**: Compare multiple transcripts simultaneously
2. **Interview Analytics**: Performance metrics and insights
3. **Export Functionality**: Export selected interview data
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, interview duration, scoring
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live status updates

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Calendar Integration**: Schedule follow-up interviews
2. **CRM Integration**: Sync with customer relationship management systems
3. **Reporting Dashboard**: Generate comprehensive interview reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **History Not Loading**
   - Check API endpoint availability
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Review browser console for errors

2. **Selection Not Working**
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - Check for console errors
   - Refresh page and try again

3. **Analysis Not Triggering**
   - Verify candidates are selected
   - Check redirect URL parameters
   - Ensure dashboard is accessible

### Debug Information
Enable debug mode by opening browser console and checking for:
- API response data
- Selection state changes
- Error messages and stack traces

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all API endpoints
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- Error message sanitization to prevent information disclosure
- Rate limiting for API endpoints (recommended for production)

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading for large interview datasets
- Client-side filtering for improved responsiveness
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large result sets (planned enhancement)
