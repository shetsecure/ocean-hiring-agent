        "question": "Tell me about a time you had to embrace a new technology or approach at work. What was the outcome?",
        "answer": "When our company decided to migrate from a monolithic architecture to microservices, I volunteered to lead the research phase. I spent weekends learning Kubernetes, Docker, and service mesh technologies. I created proof-of-concepts, presented my findings to leadership, and designed the migration strategy. The result was a 40% improvement in system scalability and deployment frequency. I genuinely love exploring new technologies - it keeps me energized and curious about solving complex problems.",
        "trait": "Openness"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you approach project planning and meeting deadlines in complex software projects?",
        "answer": "I'm extremely methodical in my approach. I start by breaking down projects into granular tasks, estimate with buffer time, and create detailed dependency maps. I use tools like Jira for tracking, set up automated CI/CD pipelines early, and implement monitoring dashboards. I conduct daily stand-ups, weekly retrospectives, and maintain detailed documentation. My projects typically finish 10-15% ahead of schedule because I anticipate risks and plan contingencies. I believe that thorough planning prevents poor performance.",

      },
      {
        "question": "Describe your communication style when working with cross-functional teams and stakeholders.",
        "answer": "I thrive in collaborative environments! I love presenting technical concepts to diverse audiences. For non-technical stakeholders, I use visual analogies and interactive demos. I regularly organize tech talks, mentor junior developers, and facilitate architecture discussions. I'm energized by brainstorming sessions and find that diverse perspectives lead to better solutions. I actively seek feedback and enjoy building consensus across teams. Communication is where technical excellence meets business impact.",
        "trait": "Extraversion"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you handle code reviews and collaborative development with team members?",
        "answer": "I approach code reviews as mentoring opportunities. I always start by acknowledging good practices, then provide constructive suggestions with detailed explanations and examples. I'm patient with junior developers and create knowledge-sharing sessions for complex topics. When receiving feedback, I'm genuinely appreciative and view it as growth opportunities. I believe in psychological safety - everyone should feel comfortable asking questions or admitting mistakes. I've mentored 8 junior developers in the past two years, and seeing their growth is incredibly rewarding.",
        "trait": "Agreeableness"
      },
      {
        "question": "Tell me about how you handle pressure, unexpected challenges, or system failures.",
        "answer": "I perform exceptionally well under pressure. During a critical production outage that affected 50,000 users, I remained calm and systematically diagnosed the issue. I coordinated the incident response, implemented a hotfix within 30 minutes, and led the post-mortem analysis. I create detailed runbooks, implement monitoring alerts, and practice disaster recovery scenarios. I actually find high-pressure situations energizing because they allow me to apply my problem-solving skills effectively. I maintain a positive attitude and help keep the team focused on solutions.",
        "trait": "Neuroticism"
      },
      {
        "question": "What's your approach to continuous learning and staying current with technology trends?",
        "answer": "I dedicate 10 hours per week to learning new technologies. I maintain a personal lab environment where I experiment with cutting-edge tools, contribute to open-source projects, and build side projects. I attend conferences, participate in tech communities, and share my learnings through blog posts and internal presentations. I recently completed certifications in cloud architecture and machine learning. I believe that continuous learning is essential in our rapidly evolving field.",
        "trait": "Openness"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you ensure code quality and system reliability in your development process?",
        "answer": "I'm obsessive about quality. I implement comprehensive testing strategies including unit tests (90%+ coverage), integration tests, and end-to-end testing. I use static analysis tools, automated security scanning, and performance profiling. I follow strict code review processes, maintain detailed documentation, and implement monitoring and alerting systems. I've reduced production bugs by 85% in my current role through these practices. Quality isn't negotiable - it's foundational to everything I build.",
        "trait": "Conscientiousness"
      },
      {
        "question": "Describe your leadership style and experience mentoring other developers.",
        "answer": "I lead by example and create environments where everyone can succeed. I organize regular tech talks, facilitate architectural discussions, and ensure junior developers have clear growth paths. I'm approachable and encourage open communication. I celebrate team achievements publicly and address challenges privately. I've successfully led cross-functional teams of 12+ people and consistently receive high feedback scores for leadership effectiveness. I believe great leaders create more leaders, not followers.",
        "trait": "Extraversion"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you balance innovation with practical business needs and constraints?",
        "answer": "I excel at finding creative solutions within constraints. I always consider the business impact of technical decisions and communicate trade-offs clearly to stakeholders. I prototype innovative solutions quickly to demonstrate value, then iterate based on feedback. I've saved my company $200K annually by optimizing infrastructure while introducing modern technologies that improved developer productivity. Innovation should solve real problems and deliver measurable value.",
        "trait": "Agreeableness"
      },
      {
        "question": "Tell me about a time when you had to troubleshoot a complex technical issue under significant time pressure.",
        "answer": "During Black Friday, our payment processing system started failing intermittently. With millions in revenue at stake, I remained completely focused and calm. I quickly assembled a war room, analyzed logs systematically, and identified a race condition in our caching layer. I implemented a surgical fix, coordinated the deployment, and monitored the recovery. We restored full functionality within 45 minutes and prevented $2M in lost sales. High-pressure situations bring out my best analytical thinking and leadership abilities.",
